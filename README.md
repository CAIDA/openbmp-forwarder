OpenBMP Forwarder
=====================
Currently this forwards the openbmp.bmp_raw stream from Kafka to a remote collector using BMP. This can
be extended support other types of forwarding.

The initial use-case for this consumer is to connect a Kafka cluster to a remote cluster using BMP as
the transport protocol.  You can also use this to connect legacy/other BMP collectors to OpenBMP.

It is possible to spoof the router address so that the receiving collector believes it is receiving messages
from the router, but this only works on a single host.  Spoofing will not work between hosts due to RPF checks.
Spoofing is automatically enabled when the destination collector is localhost.

> Forwarded messages are from the live feed.   This means that if Kafka does not have a long enough log retention
> for the RIB dump, ROUTER_UP, PEER_UP messages, then those messages will not be available till the next time
> the source collector sends them.

### TODO
* Add spoofing support for localhost

### Highlevel Flow

Forwarder enables secure access via a FW and/or NAT.  This includes the ability to translate from IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv6.
